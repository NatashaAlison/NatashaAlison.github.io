<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">Hi, I'm Natasha LaChac. Welcome to my website! I'm a master's student at American University, currently pursuing a master's degree in
Political Communication. I completed my undergraduate degree at AU this past May with a double major in Data Science for Political Science and Journalism.</p>
<p>I think that the intersection between data analysis and writing is an important one, and I intend to
pursue a career that utilizes both skill sets to the fullest. This website is an excellent example of that. Here, you'll see the creative meet the technical
and showcase the foundations of HTML, CSS, and other fun things. Have fun, go exploring, and enjoy!</p>
