<p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">Hi, I'm Natasha LaChac. Welcome to my website! I'm a senior at <a href="https://www.american.edu/" target="_blank">American University</a>, currently pursing my undergraduate degree in
Data Science for Political Science and Journalism. I have been admitted to the combined BA/MA program and indend to pursue a master's degree in Political Communication in Fall 2023.</p>
<p>I think that the intersection between data analysis and writing is an important one, and I intend to
pursue a career which utilizes both skillsets to the fullest. This website is an excellent example of that. Here, you'll see the creative meet the technical
as showcase the foundations of HTML, CSS, and other fun things. Have fun, go exploring, and enjoy!</p>
