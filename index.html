<p class="image" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">Hi, I'm Natasha LaChac. Welcome to my website! I'm a senior at <a href="https://www.american.edu/" target="_blank">American University</a>, currently pursing my undergraduate degree in
Data Science for Political Science and Journalism. I have been admitted to the combined BA/MA program and indend to pursue a master's degree in Political Communication in Fall 2023. I think that the intersection between data analysis and writing is an important one, and I intend to
pursue a career which utilizes both skillsets to the fullest. This website is an excellent example of that. Here, you'll see the creative meet the technical
as I work to program my own site using HTML and CSS, and showcase my other talents. Have fun, go exploring, and enjoy!</p>
