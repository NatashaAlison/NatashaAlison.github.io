<h2>Beginnings</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in New Jersey. Some people consider this a bad thing, even daring to call good old NJ "the armpit of the nation," but I've
grown to appreciate my home. After living my life under one of the best public education systems in the country and not pumping my own gas, I fled the nest
to Washington, DC.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>In my free time, I like to bake, crochet, listen to podcasts, and write fiction. When I have even more time, I spend it reading and slowly chipping away at my TV watchlist. 
I like to pick up hobbies just to try my hand at anything - right now, I'm trying to keep cacti alive and mastering the ancient art of Go.</p>
	<h4>Currently reading: "She Said" by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey</h4>
<h2>What's Next For Me</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Sewing: I just learned to use a sewing machine and I'm psyched to repair old clothes.</li>
	<li>Jobs jobs jobs: I'm applying to new positions as I begin my final year at AU. Wish me luck!</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was a kid, I was convinced I would be the next great American author. Now, my ambitions have shifted slightly to the left. I'm passionate about long-form journalism and enterprise stories that use data and research to paint a full picture. My 
	other ambitions include focusing on audio - podcasting, audio editing, production, you name it. My super secret ambitions (shh) are to be a writer for a sitcom or a television critic.</p>
