<h2>Beginnings</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in New Jersey. Some people consider this a bad thing, even daring to call good old NJ "the armpit of the nation," but I've
grown to appreciate my home. After living my life under one of the best public education systems in the country and not pumping my own gas, I fled the nest
to Washington, DC.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>In my free time, I like to bake, crochet, listen to podcasts, and write fiction. When I have even more time, I spend my time reading mystery novels and watching Hulu. 
I like to pick up hobbies just to try my hand at anything - this summer I'm going to brush up on my Spanish and go hiking. I just finished reading "Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires
	Behind the Rise of the Radical Right" by Jane Mayer and I cannot stop thinking about the incredible amount of research that went into it. After reading this, my official summer goal is to read 10 books, and at least 
	3 of them should also be essays.</p>
<h2>What's Next For Me</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Podcasting: My friend and I plan to release our all-things-education podcast by August. Stay tuned!</li>
	<li>Research: Following the education theme, I am currently conducting research for a second piece on RA's at my school, with hopes of publishing both in the fall.</li>
</ul>
<p>After college, I want to write. I'm passionate about long-form journalism and enterprise stories that use data and research to paint a full picture. My secret ambition 
(shh) is to be a writer for a sitcom, or a television critic.</p>
