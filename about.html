<h2>Beginnings</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in New Jersey. Some people consider this a bad thing, even daring to call good old NJ "the armpit of the nation," but I've
grown to appreciate my home. After living my life under one of the best public education systems in the country and not pumping my own gas, I fled the nest
to Washington, DC. It's been pretty great so far.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>In my free time, I like to bake, crochet, listen to podcasts, and write fiction. When I have even more time, I spend it reading and slowly chipping away at my TV watchlist. 
I like to pick up hobbies just to try my hand at anything - right now, I'm repainting old masterpieces. I just finished my rendition of "The Scream."</p>
	<h4>Currently reading: "Dune" by Frank Herbert</h4>
<h2>What's Next For Me</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Survivor: Kind of obsessed with reality TV as the largest, least ethical social experiment. I'm watching the new season of <i>Survivor</i> and contemplating 
	writing a mini-thesis on the show in my free time. You know, just for funsies.</li>
	<li>Travel: I'm embracing travel as something they say you should do in your 20s. My next destination: Japan, this summer. It'</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was a kid, I was convinced I would be the next great American author. Now, my ambitions have shifted slightly to the left. I want to do something that doesn't make me feel
	ethically icky inside. I'm passionate about long-form journalism and enterprise stories that use data and research to paint a full picture of underexplored problems. My 
	other ambitions include anything vaguely related to writing/research/data analytics/media monitoring/public relations etc etc. My super secret ambitions (shh) are to be 
	a writer for a sitcom or a television critic.</p>
