<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Beginnings</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in New Jersey. Some people consider this a bad thing, even daring to call good old NJ "the armpit of the nation," but I've
grown to appreciate my home. After living my life under one of the best public education systems in the country and not pumping my own gas, I fled the nest
to Washington, DC.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>In my free time, I like to bake, crochet, listen to podcasts, and write fiction. When I have even more time, I spend my time being a sci-fi nerd and watching Hulu. 
I like to pick up hobbies just to try my hand at anything - this spring I'm going to paint and rollerblade. I just finished reading "I Like To Watch: Arguing
My Way Through the TV Revolution" by Emily Nussbaum and I cannot stop thinking about it.</p>
<h2>What's Next For Me</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Podcasting: My friend and I plan to release our all-things-education podcast soon. Stay tuned!</li>
	<li>Research: This summer I hope to conduct independant research and pursue a journalism internship</li>
</ul>
<p>After college, I want to write. I'm passionate about long-form journalism and enterprise stories that use data and research to paint a full picture. My secret ambition 
(shh) is to be a writer for a sitcom, or a television critic.</p>
