<h2>Beginnings</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in New Jersey. Some people consider this a bad thing, even daring to call good old NJ "the armpit of the nation," but I've
grown to appreciate my home. After living my life under one of the best public education systems in the country and not pumping my own gas, I fled the nest
to Washington, DC. It's been pretty great so far.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>In my free time, I like to bake, crochet, listen to podcasts, and write fiction. When I have even more time, I spend it reading and slowly chipping away at my TV watchlist. 
I like to pick up hobbies just to try my hand at anything - right now, I'm repainting old masterpieces. I'm currently sketching my rendition of Nighthawks.</p>
	<h4>Currently reading: "Paved Paradise: How Parking Explains The World" by Henry Grabar</h4>
<h2>What's Next For Me</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The Great Outdoors: I'm taking advantage of the nice weather while it lasts. I want to go hiking and use my firepit before it's chilly again.</li>
	<li>Sports: Funnily enough, I'm not a sports person, but I've become fascinated with the idea of how we divide sports by gender and how cis women can still not be "woman" enough. NPR's <i>Tested</i> is a great intro to this topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was a kid, I was convinced I would be the next great American author. Now, my ambitions have shifted slightly to the left. I'm passionate about long-form journalism and enterprise stories that use data and research to paint a full picture of underexplored problems. My 
	other ambitions include anything vaguely related to writing/research/data analytics/communications/media monitoring/public relations etc etc. It's a big umbrella, okay? I want to do work that I can feel good about, whether that's creatively, politically, or something else.
	My super secret ambitions (shh) are to be a writer for a sitcom or a television critic. Some childhood dreams never really die.</p>
